# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Short level names for `init`, `play`, and `restart`.** Instead of spelling out
  the full slug (`promptly play stage-1-01-lru-eviction-debug`) you can now name a
  level by a one-word alias (`promptly play lru`), its number 1-20 (`promptly play
  1`), or a unique `stage-N-NN` prefix (`promptly play stage-1-01`). Resolution is
  an offline lookup against the frozen catalog, so it adds no network round-trip;
  any unrecognized name still passes straight through to the server unchanged, and
  the full slug keeps working everywhere. `promptly help` and `--help` list the
  accepted forms.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-09

A field audit of real play sessions found the capture pipeline wedging and
miscounting in ways that broke the first-run experience. This release overhauls
the session lifecycle, turn ingestion, and model pricing end-to-end. **Update
with `promptly update`** — the first daemon start after updating also cleans up
any session an older version left stranded.

### Added

- **Stale sessions are archived, never lost.** A session that is superseded (or
  found stranded at daemon startup) is stamped stopped, has its harness telemetry
  settings reverted in *its own* workspace, and is preserved under
  `~/.promptly/archive/<session_id>.json`.
- `GET /session/preflight` now reports a `blocking_session` (slug, workspace,
  started-at) when a previous session is still open elsewhere, and `promptly
  start` prints `closing the previous session (<slug>) — it was left open`
  before proceeding.

### Changed

- **Switching levels now ends the previous session cleanly.** `promptly start`
  in a new level (and `promptly down` / `promptly update`) stops the open
  capture session first — reverting the previous workspace's OTEL settings —
  instead of leaving it active forever. The daemon also refuses to adopt a
  marker bound to a different workspace at startup: it archives it and starts
  idle, self-healing state left behind by older versions.
- **`promptly start` refuses a folder that isn't a level workspace** ("run
  `promptly init <level>` or cd into one") *before* re-scoping the daemon to it.
  `promptly up` and `promptly watch` print a dim note but proceed.
- **`promptly watch` and `promptly score` now tell you what you're looking
  at:** a `session started <age> ago` header (flagged `(resumed)` when history
  was restored), a warning when the session is bound to a different level than
  the current folder, cache tokens on the token line, and the projection
  labeled for what it is — a ceiling that assumes a clear at floored run time.
  `watch` also de-duplicates its seed against the live stream, so a turn can
  never be counted twice on screen.
- The crash-recovery checkpoint format is now v3. The first start after
  updating discards an old checkpoint (its de-duplication keys use the old
  scheme): the session itself still stops/submits normally, but captured-turn
  history from before the update is not restored.

### Fixed

- **`promptly start` no longer fails with `daemon response wasn't understood:
  missing field 'status'`.** Two bugs compounded: a session left open on another
  level made the daemon refuse the start with a plain-error 409 the CLI couldn't
  parse, and nothing ever closed that session. The daemon now supersedes the
  stale session and starts fresh (all baseline attestation and reset
  confirmation protections unchanged), and the CLI surfaces any structured
  daemon error legibly instead of a decode failure.
- **Turns and tokens are no longer double-counted.** Claude Code writes one
  transcript line per content block, so a single assistant turn appears as 2–3
  lines with the same `message.id` and identical usage. The daemon recorded
  each line as its own turn (a real 8-turn session showed 24 turns and ~3× the
  tokens) and stray single-source entries could demote a run below the
  `verified` tier and even risk tripping the anti-fabrication pacing check.
  Turns now de-duplicate on the transcript's stable message id, and unmatched
  turns wait out the OTEL batch-export delay (~20 s pairing horizon; none for
  JSONL-only sessions) so telemetry merges into one turn instead of splitting.
- **Datestamped model ids now price at their real tier.** Claude Code reports
  ids like `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`; the exact-match economics lookup missed
  the matrix row and floored the run at anchor parity — halving a Haiku run's
  local projected score. Ids are now canonicalized (lowercased, separators
  normalized, one trailing `-YYYYMMDD` stripped) before lookup, mirroring the
  same fix in the web app's grader, and the adapter model map resolves
  datestamped Anthropic ids too.
- The Copilot adapter no longer double-counts turns after a restart re-scan
  (its de-duplication now keys on the chat request id).
- `promptly stop` run from a different folder now says which session it ended
  and where (`stopped the session for <slug> (in <workspace>)`), instead of
  appearing to stop the current level.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-07-08

Promptly moved from its Vercel-assigned hostname to the custom domain
**`xpromptly.com`**. This release points the daemon and CLI at it. **Update with
`promptly update`** — an older binary cannot talk to the new site's HUD.

### Changed

- **The daemon's browser CORS allowlist is now `https://xpromptly.com`** (was
  `https://trypromptly.vercel.app`). The web workspace HUD reads the daemon from
  the browser, and the allowlist is an exact-origin match, so a pre-0.1.9 daemon
  is blocked from the new site and its live HUD stays dark. Loopback dev origins
  are unaffected, and `PROMPTLY_WEB_ORIGIN` / `--web-origin` still extend the
  list (use `PROMPTLY_WEB_ORIGIN=https://xpromptly.com` as a stopgap if you can't
  update immediately).
- **The CLI's default web-app URL is now `https://xpromptly.com`** (was
  `http://localhost:3000`). `pair`, `init`, `submit`, and remote `test` therefore
  need **no configuration at all** to play against production.
  - **Breaking for local development:** working against a local `npm run dev` now
    requires `PROMPTLY_API_URL=http://localhost:3000` (or `--api-url`). It used to
    be the default. `promptly doctor` still reports which app it resolved and
    whether that's local-dev or production.
- `promptly doctor`'s unreachable-local-server hint now points back at the flag /
  env var instead of naming a production URL to opt into.

### Fixed

- **Local scores now match the server again for models added since June.** The
  vendored scoring fixture had been left at its 2026-06-29 state, so it predated
  the 46-model economics matrix. `promptly score` and `promptly watch` priced any
  newer model against the baseline floor instead of its own row. The fixture is
  resynced and the model map regenerated from it. Three resolutions change:
  - `gpt-5` and `grok-4` are priced rows now, so they match exactly instead of
    being rejected as ambiguous prefixes.
  - `kimi-k2` became ambiguous (`kimi-k2-6` vs `kimi-k2-7-code`) and stays
    unresolved rather than guessing.
  - `claude-haiku-3-5` was delisted from the matrix, so it resolves to nothing and
    its turns are marked `estimated` rather than sliding onto a differently-priced
    row.

  Codex spellings the matrix prices individually (`gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5-1-codex`,
  `gpt-5-2-codex`) now keep their own rows instead of collapsing onto one.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- `promptly update` aborted with `checking whether the daemon is running: daemon
  error: HTTP 404` when another process was already listening on the daemon's
  control port (default 8765). The "stop the daemon before swapping its binary"
  step treated *any* answer on the port as a daemon, so a non-Promptly server's
  HTTP error was fatal. The port is now classified three ways — a healthy daemon
  (stopped), a free port (nothing to do), or a foreign process (noted, and the
  update proceeds: our daemon isn't running, so its binary is free to replace).
  `promptly down` and `promptly restart` share the fix.
- `promptly start` / `play` / `up` now fail with a clear message when the control
  port is held by another process — naming the port and the `--api-port <port>`
  escape hatch — instead of a raw `HTTP 404`.

### Changed

- The CLI grew a set of terminal visuals, shared across commands and honoring
  `NO_COLOR`/`--no-color`/non-TTY output as before:
  - `promptly score` renders as a card under a section rule, with the projected
    score on its own line, a colored **correctness meter**, and a **token
    composition bar** (input `█` / output `▓` / thinking `▒`) under the token
    breakdown.
  - `promptly watch` opens with a section rule and its in-place scoreboard is
    now two lines: the running totals, then a **per-turn burn sparkline**
    (`▁▂▃▅▇`, last 24 turns) beside the live projected score.
  - `promptly status` shows the captured token mix as the same composition bar
    under the totals.
  - `promptly test` closes with a **pass-rate meter** next to `N/M passed`,
    green/yellow/red by how close the suite is to passing.
  - `promptly doctor` opens with a section rule and its verdict line is fronted
    by a compact per-check mark strip (`✓!✗` in each check's color).
  - `promptly submit` renders the parity comparison as two aligned bars —
    local best-case projection vs the server's grade — scaled to the larger.
  - `promptly help` gains a brand mark, numbered quick-start steps, and section
    headings extended by dim rules.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- `promptly submit` and `promptly score` failed with **"no active capture
  session"** after `promptly stop`, breaking the documented finish line
  (`stop` → `submit`) that the `stop` command itself points you to. Stopping a
  session only closes its capture window — the signed turns and the bound attempt
  nonce stay on the marker — so both commands now read a stopped session, not only
  an open one. They still fail on a truly idle daemon (nothing started), and
  `promptly watch` still requires an open session (it is a live follow).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- `promptly help` opens with a **QUICK START** section — the three commands that
  take a new player from nothing to a ranked solve (`pair` → `play` → `submit`).
- `promptly doctor` now aligns every check's detail into one column and closes
  with a one-line verdict (`all N checks passed`, or the warning/failure counts
  in the worst level's color), so the report ends on an unambiguous answer.
- `promptly status` shows the captured token totals (`in · out · think`) while a
  session is capturing — the numbers the attempt is scored on.
- `promptly watch` redraws its running-totals line in place on a TTY (a live
  scoreboard under the newest turn) instead of duplicating it down the
  scrollback. Piped output stays append-only.

### Fixed

- The `promptly score` breakdown columns misaligned when colors were enabled:
  the label padding was applied after ANSI styling, so the (zero-width) escape
  codes consumed the pad. Labels are now padded before styling, and the
  breakdown aligns identically with and without color.

### Security

- **The `verified` badge is now gated on authenticated, OTEL-backed Claude Code —
  every other capture ranks as `unverified`.** Scoring rewards efficiency, so the
  incentive is to under-report or fabricate a clean capture; this release makes the
  badge a server decision over *signed* evidence rather than a client claim. A
  capture reaches `verified` only with a v3 device-signed turn chain that carries a
  server-issued nonce, an attested kit baseline, at least one OTEL-backed turn, all
  turns OTEL/JSONL-sourced and non-estimated, no cross-source disagreement, and
  coherent timing. A relabelled Copilot/Cursor/Codex capture, a JSONL-only run, an
  offline (local-nonce) start, or estimated counts all rank `unverified`; a
  broken/replayed chain is `suspect`. Because the server reads only what was signed,
  editing the unsigned `telemetry_confidence` wire field no longer earns the badge.
- **Authenticated OTLP ingest.** A consented session mints a fresh per-session
  ingest token, writes it into the harness settings
  (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=X-Promptly-Otlp-Token=…`), and the receiver rejects
  any `/v1/logs`/`/v1/metrics` post that doesn't present it — and *all* posts while
  idle or JSONL-only — **before parsing the body**. This closes the biggest gap in
  the verified path: any loopback process could previously POST fabricated
  `api_request` turns to inflate or forge a run. The token rotates per session and
  is re-asserted on resume.
- **Attested kit baseline.** A fresh `start` now verifies the local (player-editable)
  `manifest.json` `baseline_hash` against the server's authoritative value (returned
  with the attempt nonce) and refuses a stale or tampered kit
  (`re-run promptly init`), so a pre-solved workspace can't be anchored to a forged
  starter. Offline starts are unattested and cap at `unverified`.
- **Turn chain v3 — signed provenance.** Each turn now signs its confidence tier,
  source set, and timestamp, and the terminal entry signs a **capture summary**
  (nonce origin, baseline attestation and reset count, bulk-paste count) alongside
  the v2 cross-source agreement. All of it is tamper-evident: the server scores
  exactly what was signed. The canonical message format is pinned byte-for-byte to
  the web app and the shared `vendor/turn-chain-vectors.json`; v1/v2 chains still
  verify for a staged rollout.
- **Pacing plausibility.** `promptly submit` now flags an implausibly paced capture
  (timestamps that jump backwards, or a burst of turns tighter than any interactive
  session) before upload — the fingerprint of a fabricated or replayed chain — and
  the server re-checks pacing over the signed timestamps.

### Added

- `promptly submit` prints the **projected trust tier** (verified-eligible vs.
  `unverified`, with the reason) before the irreversible ranked confirmation, so you
  know whether a capture earns the badge — and why not — before submitting.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-30

### Security

- The daemon's control routes (`POST /session/start|stop|reset`, `/shutdown`) now
  require a per-process **capability token**, not just the presence of the
  `X-Promptly-Control` header. The daemon mints a fresh random token at startup and
  writes it owner-only (`0600` on Unix; the user-profile ACL on Windows) to
  `~/.promptly/control.json`; the `promptly` CLI reads it to authenticate. This
  shuts out a local non-browser process that could otherwise stop a rival's
  session, force a shutdown, or inject a session start by setting the old constant
  header. The token rotates every start, so a stale file can't drive a new daemon.
- Every API route now rejects a request whose `Host` header names a non-loopback
  authority, closing DNS rebinding as a third layer over the loopback-only bind and
  the CORS origin lock.
- The crash-recovery checkpoint is now **sealed** with a tamper-evident hash chain
  over the captured turns (`ledger`), committing to the integrity signals (the
  contributing sources, cross-source agreement, and plausibility) as well as the
  token counts. On load the daemon recomputes the seal and starts fresh if it no
  longer matches, so an offline edit of the persisted capture (lowering a turn's
  tokens, deleting a turn, hiding a disagreement) is denied rather than resumed and
  counted toward an attempt. The checkpoint format is now v2.
- The embedded OTLP receiver now also rejects a non-loopback `Host`, closing
  DNS-rebind telemetry injection — a rebound page's same-origin POST would
  otherwise sidestep the receiver's no-CORS posture and feed fabricated turns into
  the capture stream.
- `promptly submit` now reads the capture's integrity signals (cross-source
  agreement and plausibility) before uploading and **fails closed** on a tampering
  fingerprint: a capture carrying cross-source disagreements or implausible turns is
  not pushed by the routine `--yes` — it requires an explicit `--force` (or an
  interactive acknowledgement), so a flagged capture can't be recorded as a ranked
  attempt silently. The server still re-derives the authoritative verdict.
- The signed turn chain is now **`chain_version` 2**: the OTEL↔JSONL cross-source
  corroboration summary (how many turns disagreed, and on which fields) is signed
  into the terminal entry alongside `final_code_hash`. Previously this summary was
  never uploaded, so the server's cross-source integrity check had nothing to act
  on; now it rides inside the device-signed chain, so a forked daemon can't strip or
  zero it to hide fabricated turns without breaking the terminal signature (the
  server then grades the run `suspect`). The server verifies v1 and v2 chains, so
  it can be redeployed ahead of this release; older daemons keep submitting v1.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- `promptly restart [<level>]` — discard the current attempt and re-fetch the
  level fresh in the same folder: it stops the daemon, clears the bound attempt
  and the solve clock, wipes the workspace (keeping `.git`), and re-downloads the
  pristine kit, so the next `promptly start` is a brand-new attempt. The kit is
  downloaded before anything is deleted, so a failed (e.g. offline) restart
  changes nothing.

### Changed

- `promptly submit` now confirms before the ranked upload — it records an attempt
  and can't be undone. Pass `--yes` to skip the prompt; a non-interactive shell
  must pass `--yes` to submit.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- `promptly play <level>` — fetch a level, launch the daemon, and start capturing
  in a single command.
- `promptly up` / `promptly down` — start and stop the background daemon explicitly.
- The daemon's `GET /health` now reports its scoped `workspace`, and a guarded
  `POST /shutdown` route stops it gracefully.
- `promptly help` — a grouped, styled overview of every command.
- `promptly update` — upgrade the installed `promptly` + `promptlyd` binaries to
  the latest GitHub release in place (`--check` reports availability without
  installing). Downloads the prebuilt archive for your platform, stops the
  running daemon, and swaps both binaries.
- An automatic update check: after a command, `promptly` prints a one-line notice
  when a newer release is available (cached to once a day, interactive terminals
  only; `promptly doctor` reports the same status). Opt out with
  `PROMPTLY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`.

### Changed

- The CLI now auto-manages the `promptlyd` daemon: `promptly start`, `watch`, and
  `play` launch it in the background scoped to your level (relaunching it when you
  switch levels), so you no longer run `promptlyd run` in a separate terminal. The
  background daemon detaches fully from the CLI's streams, so piping or capturing a
  command's output never blocks, and a relaunch (or `promptly down`) waits for the
  previous daemon to exit cleanly before continuing.

### Removed

- The redundant `promptly login` command. It never signed you in — device auth is
  the device-authorization flow (`promptly pair`) — it only reported whether a
  credential already existed, which `promptly doctor` already covers.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- `promptlyd` local telemetry daemon: an embedded OTLP/HTTP receiver and a Claude
  Code JSONL session-log watcher, cross-source correlation and de-duplication, and
  a localhost-only HTTP API (`/health`, `/session`, `/stream`, plus CLI-only
  control routes).
- Best-effort Cursor / OpenAI Codex CLI / GitHub Copilot Chat adapters: read-only,
  inferred counts marked `estimated`, detection state surfaced via `promptly
  doctor`.
- Session scoping: workspace binding to a level manifest, a baseline integrity
  check with backup-and-reset, the attempt nonce, and an OTEL harness bootstrap
  gated on explicit consent.
- `promptly` CLI: `pair`, `init`, `start` / `stop` / `reset`, `test`, `watch`,
  `score`, `doctor`, and `submit` — local scoring with parity to the server and a
  redacted, device-signed ranked upload.
- One-line install scripts (`install.sh` / `install.ps1`) and cross-platform
  release binaries (Linux, macOS arm64/x86_64, Windows) published on `v*` tags.
